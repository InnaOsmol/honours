## Forests without borders - are plants in the southern hemisphere moving poleward to survive and are we trying to stop them?

Species in many parts of the world are undergoing dramatic range shifts in response to climate change. However, there has never been a quantification of range shifts in terrestrial plant species in the southern hemisphere. In this project, I aim to address this knowledge gap. I will also investigate a conceptual dilemma in managing range shifting species. Effective range shifts of plant species that track rates of climate change are considered a crucial advantage to the survivability of these species, but current vegetation management practices in many parts of the world favour keeping species in their historical locations. I will investigate whether people involved in vegetation management consider range shifts important for speciesâ€™ persistence under climate change and ask whether they would remove plants that move into areas in which they did not historically occur. The knowledge gained from this study will be used to inform and influence the management actions and conservation policies relating to range shifting species, a critical step in managing our increasingly changing ecosystems for the future.
